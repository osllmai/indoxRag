- `url` (Optional[str]): The URL at which Pathway Vector Store listens.

### Installation

You can connect to the Pathway Vector Store by creating an instance of the `PathwayVectorClient`:

```

Query the vector store:

```python
query = "How can Cinderella reach her happy ending?"
retriever = indox.QuestionAnswer(vector_database=client, llm=mistral_qa, top_k=5, document_relevancy_filter=True)
answer = retriever.invoke(query=query)
```
