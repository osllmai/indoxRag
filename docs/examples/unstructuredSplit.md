# Unstructured Load And Split


```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

## Initial Setup

The following imports are essential for setting up the Indox application. These imports include the main Indox retrieval augmentation module, question-answering models, embeddings, and data loader splitter.


```python
from indox import IndoxRetrievalAugmentation
indox = IndoxRetrievalAugmentation()
```

### Generating response using OpenAI's language models 
OpenAIQA class is used to handle question-answering task using OpenAI's language models. This instance creates OpenAiEmbedding class to specifying embedding model. Here ChromaVectorStore handles the storage and retrieval of vector embeddings by specifying a collection name and sets up a vector store where text embeddings can be stored and queried.


```python
from indox.llms import OpenAiQA
from indox.embeddings import OpenAiEmbedding
openai_qa = OpenAiQA(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY, model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0125")
embed_openai = OpenAiEmbedding(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,model="text-embedding-3-small")

from indox.vector_stores import ChromaVectorStore
db = ChromaVectorStore(collection_name="sample",embedding=embed_openai)
indox.connect_to_vectorstore(vectorstore_database=db)
```




    <indox.vector_stores.Chroma.ChromaVectorStore at 0x1d0407cb440>



### load and preprocess data
This part of code demonstrates how to load and preprocess text data from a file, split it into chunks, and store these chunks in the vector store that was set up previously.


```python
file_path = "sample.txt"
```


```python
from indox.data_loader_splitter import UnstructuredLoadAndSplit
loader_splitter = UnstructuredLoadAndSplit(file_path=file_path,max_chunk_size=400)
docs = loader_splitter.load_and_chunk()
```


```python
indox.store_in_vectorstore(docs=docs)
```




    <indox.vector_stores.Chroma.ChromaVectorStore at 0x1d0407cb440>



### Retrieve relevant information and generate an answer
The main purpose of these lines is to perform a query on the vector store to retrieve the most relevant information (top_k=5) and generate an answer using the language model.


```python
query = "How Cinderella reach her happy ending?"
retriever = indox.QuestionAnswer(vector_database=db, llm=openai_qa, top_k=5)
```

invoke(query) method sends the query to the retriever, which searches the vector store for relevant text chunks and uses the language model to generate a response based on the retrieved information.
Context property retrieves the context or the detailed information that the retriever used to generate the answer to the query. It provides insight into how the query was answered by showing the relevant text chunks and any additional information used.


```python
retriever.invoke(query)
retriever.context
```

### With AgenticRag

AgenticRag stands for Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation. This concept combines retrieval-based methods and generation-based methods in natural language processing (NLP). The key idea is to enhance the generative capabilities of a language model by incorporating relevant information retrieved from a database or a vector store. 
 AgenticRag is designed to provide more contextually rich and accurate responses by utilizing external knowledge sources. It retrieves relevant pieces of information (chunks) from a vector store based on a query and then uses a language model to generate a comprehensive response that incorporates this retrieved information.


```python
agent = indox.AgenticRag(llm=openai_qa,vector_database=db,top_k=5)
agent.run(query)
```
